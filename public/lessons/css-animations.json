  "content": "Animations are a great way to add life to your site. They can be in the form of two main animations: animations that only show on page load or animations that are constantly running. First, let’s learn how to make a load animation. Take a look at this simple page below: \n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Load animation step 1' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/XWBeJwo?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>\n\nHow can we add animations to it? A feature of CSS called `keyframes`. We use it like this:\n\n```css\n@keyframes fade {\n  from {opacity: 0;}\n  to {opacity: 1;}\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the animation’s name is `fade-in`, and we’re animating from 0 opacity to 1 opacity. Let’s apply this to the page by giving each element some properties.\n\n```css\nh1,h2,p {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: fade;\n}\n```\n\n`animation-duration` sets the time that the animation will run for, and `animation-name` sets the animation that it will run. In this case, we named the previous animation `fade`, so we’re setting the `animation-name` to `fade`. Check it out:\n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Load animation step 2' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/preview/PoBJwrW?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>\n\nNow, what if we want to stagger the loading of the elements to make it look cooler? We can use another property called `animation-delay`. Let’s apply it:\n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Load animation step 2' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/preview/ExpwjxJ?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>\n\nUh oh! There’s a problem. When the page loads, each element is still visible until the animation is applied. How can we fix this? There are two things you need to do. First, you need to make the element have the same styling as it does at the start of the animation. Here, we have it going from `opacity: 0;` to `opacity: 1`, so I’ll start by giving all elements with the animation an opacity of 0. If you go ahead and test this out, you’ll notice another problem. Once the animation is done, the element will go back to being invisible. We can fix that with `animation-fill-mode: forwards;`. This makes it so the animation will stay after it ends. Let’s see the final result: \n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Load animation step 4' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/preview/NWBaqqw?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>\n\nCool, huh?\n\n## Making infinite animations\n\nIf you have an animation that you want to happen multiple times, you can use `animation-iteration-count`, and set it to the number of times you want it to happen. You can also set it to `infinite` to make it repeat forever. Check out this animation I’ve created:\n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Load animation step 4' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/preview/yLqzNNq?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>\n\nYou might notice a problem with this though. It’s not a smooth animation. That’s because the default easing is `ease-out`, which makes it have that effect (Remember easings from the last lesson? Hover animations have the same default). To fix this, set the `animation-timing-function` to `linear`\n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Repeating animation' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/preview/wvxraMr?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>",
