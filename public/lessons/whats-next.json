  "content": "Your journey on making the web less [boring] hasn’t ended yet, in fact, it’s just starting. Next, I’d suggest learning how to use the [Green Sock Animation Platform (GSAP)](https://greensock.com/get-started/), specifically, their [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) plugin. The reason there’s not a dedicated lesson for that here is because they have great documentation, and [a community](https://greensock.com/forums/) where you can get support and ask questions.\n\nHere are some more resources I’d suggest looking into or using:\n\n- Animate.css | [https://animate.style/](https://animate.style/)\n- anime.js | [https://animejs.com/](https://animejs.com/)\n\nYou can find more on the [[boring] resources page](https://boring.samalander.dev/tools-resources)!\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThere are some great sites for inspiration on [[boring]’s inspiration page](https://boring.samalander.dev/inspiration), but if you can’t wait for more to be added, here’s are some great places to find more inspiration:\n\n- Awwwards CSS & JS Animations Collection | [https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/css-js-animations/](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/css-js-animations/)\n- Godly | [https://godly.website/](https://godly.website/)\n- Land-book Animation Section | [https://land-book.com/?style=Animation](https://land-book.com/?style=Animation)\n\nIf you need any support in making the web less [boring], feel free to message me on Discord at [Samalander#1336](https://discord.com/users/588480933108121618), or email me at [sam@samalander.dev](https://www.notion.so/Web-Dev-a79a5aed59774d46bc4535cc28562505).
