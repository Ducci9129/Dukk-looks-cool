  "content": "Scroll animations are amazing. They add a ton of life to your site and make it feel so much more full of life. After learning how to add them, I never went back. We’re going to be starting with a library called [Animate On Scroll or AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). \n\nThe first thing you have to do is import the package’s CSS in your `<head>` element.\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <link href='https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.css' rel='stylesheet'>\n</head>\n```\n\nNext, import the AOS JavaScript inside of your `<body>` element.\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <script src='https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.js'></script>\n</body>\n```\n\nAdditionally, you have to initialize the package inside of a `<script>` tag.\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <script src='https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.js'></script>\n  <script>\n    AOS.init();\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\n## Adding The Animations\n\nNow that AOS is setup, let’s get to the fun part: Adding animations! AOS has a variety of animations which you can view on [the website](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). Add an animation by adding the `data-aos` attribute and setting it to the animation that you want. For example:\n\n```html\n<div data-aos='fade-up'></div>\n```\n\nYou can also use other attributes like `data-aos-duration` to change the animation time and `data-aos-offset` to change when the animation gets triggered.\n\n## The Result\n\nHere’s the final result:\n\n<iframe height='300' style='width: 100%;' scrolling='no' title='Scroll Animations' src='https://codepen.io/samalander0/embed/preview/PoBJqEO?default-tab=html%2Cresult&editable=true&theme-id=dark' frameborder='no' loading='lazy' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true'>\n</iframe>\n\nTry playing around with the animations and values! Next lesson, we’ll get into where you can go next, and how to create animations that are based on the scroll position, like the ones at my website at [samalander.dev](https://www.samalander.dev).",
